# Rock_v-s_Mine-Prediction-by-using-ML

A data science project to classify objects as Rock or Mine using the Sonar Dataset by using linear regression model in Python.

The project involved:

Data Acquisition: Leveraging publicly available datasets from Kaggle.
Data Preparation: Cleaning and preprocessing the data to ensure accuracy and reliability.
Model Training and Testing: Splitting the data into training and testing sets using train-test split to validate the model.
Prediction: Successfully predicting whether an object is a rock or a mine using the Sonar Dataset.

It was fascinating to turn raw data into actionable insights using Python.

Results :
Training Data Accuracy: 83.42%
Test Data Accuracy: 76.19%
